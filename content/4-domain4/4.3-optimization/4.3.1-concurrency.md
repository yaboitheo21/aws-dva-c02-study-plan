## Define Concurrency

### Lambda Concurrency Types

| Type | Mô tả | Cold Start |
|------|--------|------------|
| Unreserved | Shared pool (account default 1000) | Yes |
| Reserved | Guaranteed + capped for function | Yes |
| Provisioned | Pre-initialized containers | **No** |

### Concurrency Formula

```text
Concurrency = Invocations/second × Average duration (seconds)
Example: 100 req/s × 0.5s = 50 concurrent executions
```

### Key Rules

- Account default: 1000 concurrent
- Reserved = 0 → function disabled
- Throttling → `429 TooManyRequestsException`
- Burst: 500-3000 (region dependent)
- Unreserved pool = Account limit - all reserved

| Scenario | Type |
|----------|------|
| Default | Unreserved |
| Critical function | Reserved |
| Eliminate cold starts | Provisioned |
| Disable function | Reserved = 0 |

{{% notice tip %}}
**Exam Tip:** Reserved = guarantee + cap. Provisioned = no cold starts ($). Reserved = 0 disables function. Account limit shared across all functions.
