## Profile Application Performance

### Amazon CodeGuru Profiler

**What it does**:
- Profile application performance
- Provide **different visualizations** of profiling data
- Identify what code is running
- Show how much time is consumed
- Recommend performance improvements

**Features**:
- Continuous profiling for Java, Python
- Identifies expensive code paths
- Recommendations for optimization
- Integration with Lambda and EC2
- Flame graphs, heat maps

**Use cases**:
- Find CPU-intensive code
- Identify memory leaks
- Optimize resource usage
- Reduce latency

### Lambda Power Tuning

**How to determine minimum memory and compute power**:
- Manually run tests, OR
- Use **AWS Lambda Power Tuning tool** to automate process and graph results

- Open-source tool by Alex Casalboni
- Tests function with different memory settings
- Outputs optimal memory/cost/duration balance
- Step Functions-based workflow

128MB → Duration: 2000ms, Cost: $0.000004
256MB → Duration: 1000ms, Cost: $0.000004
512MB → Duration: 500ms,  Cost: $0.000004  ← optimal
1024MB → Duration: 480ms, Cost: $0.000008
```

### AWS Compute Optimizer

**What it does**:
- Identify optimal resource configurations
- **EC2 instance types**
- **EBS volume configurations**
- **Lambda function memory sizes**

**How it works**:
- Analyzes historical utilization metrics
- Machine learning recommendations
- Cost and performance trade-offs

### Lambda REPORT Line

```text
REPORT RequestId: xxx
Duration: 250.00 ms
Billed Duration: 300 ms
Memory Size: 256 MB
Max Memory Used: 240 MB    ← Close! Increase memory
Init Duration: 500.00 ms   ← Cold start
```

### X-Ray for Performance

- Trace latency per service
- Identify slow subsegments
- Compare traces over time
- Service Map shows bottlenecks
