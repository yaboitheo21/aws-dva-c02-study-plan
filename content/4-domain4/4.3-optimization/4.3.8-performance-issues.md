## Analyze Application Performance Issues

### Common Performance Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Tool to Diagnose |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| High latency | Cold starts, slow dependencies | X-Ray, REPORT line |
| Throttling | Concurrency/capacity limits | CloudWatch Metrics |
| Timeouts | Slow downstream service | X-Ray Service Map |
| Memory errors | Under-provisioned | REPORT Max Memory Used |
| Inconsistent latency | Cold starts | Init Duration in logs |

### X-Ray for Performance Analysis

```text
Client → API GW (5ms) → Lambda (250ms) → DynamoDB (10ms)
                                        → External API (500ms) ← bottleneck!
```

- Service Map: Visual bottleneck identification
- Trace timeline: Per-service latency breakdown
- Annotations: Filter traces by business context

### CloudWatch Contributor Insights

- Top-N contributors to metrics
- DynamoDB: Most accessed partition keys
- API Gateway: Most called APIs
- VPC Flow Logs: Top talkers

### Performance Optimization Workflow

```text
1. Identify: CloudWatch Metrics (errors, latency, throttles)
2. Diagnose: X-Ray traces, Logs Insights queries
3. Analyze: REPORT line, Service Map, Contributor Insights
4. Optimize: Right-size, cache, async, batch
5. Verify: Compare metrics before/after
```

**Exam Tip:** X-Ray Service Map = visual bottleneck finder. Contributor Insights = top-N analysis. REPORT line = Lambda-specific performance data. Always measure before and after optimization.
